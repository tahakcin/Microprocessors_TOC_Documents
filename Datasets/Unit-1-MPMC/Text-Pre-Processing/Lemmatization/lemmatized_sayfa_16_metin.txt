unit-1 introduction 8086 ece department microprocessor microcontrollers page 16  mode , control signal given microprocessor chip . single microprocessor minimum mode system . remaining component system latch , transreceivers , clock generator , memory i/o device .  type chip selection logic may required selecting memory i/o device , depending upon address map system .  general system organization shown figure . figure : minimum mode 8086 system  latch generally buffered output d-type flip-flop , like , 74ls373 8282 .  used separating valid address multiplexed address/data signal controlled ale signal generated 8086 .  since 20 address line 16 data line , 8086 cpu requires three octal address latch two octal data buffer complete address data separation .  transreceivers bidirectional buffer sometimes called data amplifier . required separate valid data time multiplexed address/data signal .  controlled two signal , namely , den ’ dt/r ’ . den ’ signal indicates valid data available data bus , dt/r ’ indicates direction data , i.e . processor .  system contains memory monitor user program storage . usually , eprom used monitor storage , ram user program storage .  system may contain i/o device communication processor well special purpose i/o device .  clock generator generates clock crystal oscillator shape divide make precise used accurate timing reference system .  clock generator also synchronizes external signal system clock .  working minimum mode configuration system better described term timing diagram rather qualitatively describing operation .
