unit-1 introduction 8086 ece department microprocessor microcontrollers page 5  simple word , biu handle transfer data address bus execution unit . 8086 pipelining architecture :  eu decoding instruction executing instruction , require use bus , biu fetch six instruction byte following instruction .  biu store pre-fetched byte first-in-first-out register set called queue .  eu ready next instruction queue biu . much faster sending address system memory waiting memory send back next instruction byte byte .  except case jmp call instruction , queue must dumped reloaded starting new address , pre-fetch queue scheme greatly speed processing .  fetching next instruction current instruction executes called pipelining . register organization :  8086 powerful set register known general purpose register special purpose register .  16-bit register .  general purpose register : register used either 8-bit register 16-bit register . may either used holding data , variable intermediate result temporarily purpose like counter storing offset address particular addressing mode etc .  special purpose register : register used segment register , pointer , index register offset storage register particular addressing mode .  8086 register classified following type : general data register segment register pointer index register flag register general data register :  register ax , bx , cx dx general purpose 16-bit register .  ax used 16-bit accumulator . lower 8-bit designated al higher 8-bit designated ah . al used 8-bit accumulator 8-bit operation .  data register used either 16 bit 8 bit . bx 16 bit register , bl indicates lower 8-bit bx bh indicates higher 8-bit bx .  register bx used offset storage forming physical address case certain addressing mode .  register cx used default counter case string loop instruction .  dx register general purpose register may used implicit operand destination case instruction .
