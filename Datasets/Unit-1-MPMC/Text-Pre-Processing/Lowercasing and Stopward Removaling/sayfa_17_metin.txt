unit-1 introduction 8086 ece department microprocessors microcontrollers page 17  opcode fetch read cycles similar . hence timing diagram categorized two parts , first timing diagram read cycle second timing diagram write cycle . timing diagrams :  timing diagram graphical representation operations microprocessor respect time .  state : one cycle clock called state .  machine cycle : basic microprocessor operation reading byte memory writing byte port called machine cycle made one state .  instruction cycle : time required microprocessor fetch execute entire instruction called instruction cycle made one machine cycle . note : instruction cycle made machine cycles , machine cycle made states . time state determined frequency clock signal . read cycle timing diagram minimum mode :  best way analyze timing diagram one think time vertical line moving left right across diagram .  read cycle begins t1 assertion address latch enable ( ale ) signal also m/io ’ signal .  negative going edge signal , valid address latched local bus . bhe ’ a0 signals address low , high bytes .  t1 t4 , m/io ’ signal indicate memory i/o operation . t2 , address removed local bus sent output . bus tristated . read ( ) control signal also activated t2 .
